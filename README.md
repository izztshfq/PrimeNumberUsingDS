# PrimeNumberUsingDS

> A distributed program to speed up the prime number finding within the specified number range.

## Intro
The purpose of this assignment is to strengthen your understanding to speed up an intense computation problem using distributed system concept.  In this assignment, your team is required to design and implement a distributed program to speed up the prime number finding within the specified number range.  A prime number is a positive integer evenly divisible by exactly two positive integers:  itself and 1.
The program can be speed up by distributing the finding effort using numbers of the process and/or thread, which can be located within a machine or spread to different machines. In this assignment, you need to demonstrate the use of client and server architecture, the multi threaded server means multiple process/thread can access the service at any one time, remote procedure call (RPC) or/and socket programming to involve methods that are located on different machines. Refer to Figure 1.
Please note that the threads showed in Figure 1 are replaceable with processes.  The choice of using process and/or thread is up to the individual team.
